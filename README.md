A short summary of interesting NLP papers

This is meant as a quick reference for personal use, to facilitate recalling particular ideas and models explored in the NLP research community.

The focus in these summaries would be the architecture of the models used, and not so much of the results. As such, not much will be said about the results. Rather, the architecture will be explained in more detail, and in some cases, with pictures (usually from the paper itself).
